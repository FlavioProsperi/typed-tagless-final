Annotated Scala version of Oleg's Typed Tagless Final Interpreters: Lecture Notes

Contains all source code from Oleg's course on [Typed Tagless Final Interpreters](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/index.html) converted to Scala. The [paper](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/lecture.pdf) describes many alternatives of initial and final encoding and discusses the relative advantages and disadvantages. Also the [course materials](http://okmij.org/ftp/tagless-final/course/index.html) have the corresponding Haskell code.
